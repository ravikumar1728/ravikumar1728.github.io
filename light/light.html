The system is basically a one-dimensional interacting spin chain and the atomic medium
is coupled to photon baths at the boundaries as shown in figure below
We want to describe the photon transport and its interaction with spin-
chains.We here find both transient and steady-state transport properties
of a monochromatic laser light passing through an atomic medium mod-
eled as a Heisenberg-type interacting spin- 1/2 chain.We study several
properties of the system such as reflection coefficients $R(t)$ ,transmission
coefficients $\tau(t)$ at transient state and at steady state.

I used the Quantum Langevin Equation QLE approach to calculate nonlinear light 
 propagation through one-dimensional (1D) interacting quantum lattice models 
connected to photon baths at the boundaries. The QLE approach for nonequilibrium transport is an extension of
the Heisenberg-Langevin equation approach to nonequilibrium open quantum systems. 
We write Quantum Langevin Equation corresponding to the
system and use these to describe the system properties. 

<p>System
<p>
We first apply the QLE approach to an atomic medium of two-atoms modeled 
as a Heisenberg-type interacting spin- 1/2 chain with nearest-neighbor
coupling.
The total Hamiltonian consisting of the atomic medium of two atoms(1),the
photon baths(2,3), and the atom-photon coupling(4,5) terms is :

Photon Transport 
<p>
We are here only interested in getting total transmitted and reflected power
which in turn would give transmission and reflection coefficients of light.
The time-dependent transmission and reflection coefficients for an incoming light from the left of the medium.

The time-dependent transmission cocfficients :
T(t) =
<br>
The time-dependent reflection coefficients :

R(t) = 14

Transient Properties of Scattered Light
<p>
Transient properties of the scattered light and the atoms in a medium of
two atoms driven by a laser light. Figure (1,2) depict time-evolution of
transmission coefficient 72(t) and reflection coefficient Ro(t) of a laser
light from the left of the medium modeled as an interacting spin chain.
Figure (3.4) depict. time evolution of excited atoms scaled by power of
the incident laser.

The common parameters are

Wy = We = Wy = Wa = 0.05u,,T, =T'R = 0.14.
<p>
Steady State Properties
<p>
Linear and nonlinear laser transmission through an atomic medium of
two atoms modeled as an interacting spin chain.The steady state
transmission coefficient 7)(t = 00) vs scaled frequency w,/w, of the laser
for various intensities (in o E) of the incident laser.

In all the plots Ty = Tp = 0.1, J, = 0.05. The rates 2,0 pr, Je, Jz and
w, 2 are in units of we, and Jin is in units of w/v,.
